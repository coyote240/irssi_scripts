# IRSSI Scripts

Since I've joined a team working on an entirely open source project, I now find
myself spending a lot of time on IRC using the IRSSI client.  I've looked at
newer, GUI clients but they are all abysmal.  Clearly console clients remain the
way to go.  Besides, I'm enjoying the nostalgia.

But what is IRC without scripting?  So, after many years of engineering, I find
myself a script kiddie.  If you find these scripts useful, awesome.  No fitness
for any purpose is implied.  Use at your own risk.
